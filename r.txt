Netflix satisfies the action itch with hunky Chris Hemsworth doing the scratching while a literary bestseller gets turned into a harsh Aussie Western of the highest order. Here are some new releases that are worth streaming.

“Extraction”: Stuntman-turned-director Sam Hargraves’ Netflix debut feature is unabashed high-octane escapism, a loud throwback to the action flicks of the 1980s and ’90s that featured macho heroes like Jean-Claude Van Damme, Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, and so on.

Now, it’s able-bodied Chris Hemsworth’s turn to play the fearless anti-hero hired gun who’s packing a past and a conscience. Needing the loot, Tyler (Hemsworth) signs on to Ovi rescue the kidnapped son of an imprisoned drug lord in Bangladesh. Others want the kid’s head too.

That slip of a setup — based on Joe Russo’s adaptation of his own graphic novel — triggers breathtaking — and outlandish —  action sequences, one of which is a dazzling 11-minute, sorta one-take spectacle with Tyler and Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) dodging bullets, cars, fists of fury and then sprinting through an apartment building. It’s the film’s best scene, and edited like a viper-like video game. There’s even an emotional payoff at the film’s end.
